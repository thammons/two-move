# Two-Move!

## Motivation
- The goal of this was to build a simple app - no frameworks - for my kids to hack on as they learn to code
- This repo contains multiple versions that have the same game rewritten as complexity grew (it's a bit of a mess)
- **Blockly** 
    - in order to allow the younger kids to learn to 'think like a programmer', blockly has been added to interact with the game
- **V1** 
    - version 1 was vanilla JS and HTML and minimal CSS to give a basic game my oldest son (10yo at the time of creation) can tinker with

- In later versions, I intend to use this to learn:
    - Sustainable software methodologies
    - Other languages (rust? go?)
