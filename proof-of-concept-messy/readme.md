# This project needs documentation

## Lucas
- I added `twomove\_lucas\highscore.html`
    - follow the comments in the file 
- If you're more in a typescript mood,
    - open `twomove\two-move-ts\_lucas\highscore.ts`
    - follow the comments in the file
- comments 
    - Javascript / Typescript
    - *this only applys to the specified files and code sections*
    - `/* this kind of comment I'm using as a notes section */`
    - `//TODO: Lucas:`
        - these kind of comments are prefixed to be searchable
        - my hope is they provide acheivable goals
    - `//somecode()`
        - these comments are for you to uncomment
